### Problem Statement
Your friend is good at blogging and wishes to have an online presence. Help him out by Designing a website for the same, to feature his works with integrated CMS/ Admin Portal so that he can edit/add/delete the blogs without any proper coding sense.

### Our Solution
Presenting *Blooger*, a blog web application which allows the author to dispaly formatted data in his blogs without any knowledge of HTML, CSS or markdown. With the help of our online word processor, the author can customise his blog in whatever way he wants. He/She can also add images, youtube videos or link to other websites in the blog. The viewers can also ask their queries or give feedback in the comment section provided for each blog.
